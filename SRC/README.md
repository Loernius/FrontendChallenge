# Nibo front end challenge

Tournament runner developed for the front end challenge for Nibo.

I've used some implementations from some previous projects of mine, such as the toastServices.
The development was made around 4 teams tournaments for simplicity and the low time for development. Some triggers were made to start a development for a more versatile tournament generator. Maybe I'll do it for fun, when I have some time.

For theming, I did use ng-bootstrap. That is a simple and agile framework for web-development. For a more immersive design it would require much more time.

## Usage

#### Firstly install the packages with
    npm install

#### Then just run the application with
    npm start
